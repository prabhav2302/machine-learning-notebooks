# Machine Learning Notebooks
This repository contains some of the machine learning notebooks I have coded for both class work and personal exploration. Below, you can find an overview of the contents of each file.

| conv_net.ipynb      |This is a convolutional neural network I designed using the Keras library and trained/tested on the CIFAR 10 image dataset. Furthermore I conducted an exploration on as to how implemeting techniques such as Dropout Regularization, Weight Decay, and Data Augmentation would impact the accuracy of the model.|
