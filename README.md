# Machine Learning Notebooks
This repository contains some of the machine learning notebooks I have coded for class work, internships, and personal exploration. Below, you can find an overview of the contents of each file.

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| conv_net.ipynb      |This is a convolutional neural network I designed using the Keras library and trained/tested on the CIFAR 10 image dataset. I also conducted an exploration on as to how implemeting techniques such as Dropout Regularization, Weight Decay, and Data Augmentation would impact the accuracy of the model.|
| cross_validation.ipynb     | In this notebook I coded a cross validation function from scratch        |
| decision_tree.ipynb      | Over here I coded a decision tree from scratch without using any ML libraries. I then trained/tested my model on the IRIS flower dataset. |
| generative_adversarial_networks.ipynb      | This is a GAN I coded using TensorFlow. The GAN was trained on the widely available celebA image dataset, and at the end the network was able to generate fake celebrity images! |
| googlenet_cnn.ipynb  | This is a CNN I coded using TensorFlow. The CNN  implements the GoogleNet CNN framework and I trained/tested it on the CIFAR 10 image dataset|
| gradient_descent.ipynb| A small exploration into local and global minimas in gradient descent. I used contour plots and 3D graphs for visualization. |
| kmeans_clustering.ipynb   | Here I coded a KMeans model from scratch. I also experimented with the random seed to vary centroid intialization and observe the impact it had on model accuracy |
| linear_regression.ipynb    | A basic implementation of linear regression from scratch. I also investigated the difference between linear and ridge regression  |
| logistic_regression.ipynb  | Here I coded a logistic regression model from scratch and trained/tested the model on a widely used breast cancer dataset|
| robust_pca.ipynb  | In this notebook I coded a robust PCA function from scratch which can isolate and extract the moving part (foreground) of a video. I applied my model to a elevator sequence with moving people and was able to isolate the people from the sequence! |
| support_vector_machine.ipynb | Here, I code a SVM which solves the hard margin problem and another SVM which solves the primal problem. |
