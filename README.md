# Machine Learning Notebooks
This repository contains some of the machine learning notebooks I have coded for both class work and personal exploration. Below, you can find an overview of the contents of each file.

| File      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| conv_net.ipynb      |This is a convolutional neural network I designed using the Keras library and trained/tested on the CIFAR 10 image dataset. I also conducted an exploration on as to how implemeting techniques such as Dropout Regularization, Weight Decay, and Data Augmentation would impact the accuracy of the model.|
| cross_validation.ipynb     | In this notebook I coded a cross validation function from scratch        |
| decision_tree.ipynb      | Over here I coded a decision tree from scratch without using any ML libraries. I then trained/tested my model on the IRIS flower dataset. |
| generative_adversarial_networks.ipynb      | This is a GAN I coded using TensorFlow. The GAN was trained on the widely available celebA image dataset, and at the end, the network was able to generate fake celebrity images! |
